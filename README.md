# Spring AI Demo Project (Groovy Edition)

This project demonstrates a basic integration of Spring AI with a Spring Boot application, using Gradle with Groovy build scripts.

## Overview

The application provides a simple REST endpoint that accepts a text prompt and returns a response generated by an AI model (specifically OpenAI's GPT models via Spring AI).

## Prerequisites

*   **Java 17 or later:** Ensure you have a compatible JDK installed.
*   **Gradle:** The project uses the Gradle wrapper (`gradlew`), so you don't need a separate Gradle installation.
*   **OpenAI API Key:** You'll need an API key from OpenAI to use their models.

## Configuration

1.  **Set Your OpenAI API Key:**
    The application requires your OpenAI API key to be configured. Open the file:
    `src/main/resources/application.properties`

    Find the line:
    ```properties
    spring.ai.openai.api-key=YOUR_API_KEY
    ```
    Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual OpenAI API key.

2.  **Model Selection (Optional):**
    By default, the project is configured to use `gpt-3.5-turbo`. You can change this by modifying the `spring.ai.openai.model` property in the same `application.properties` file:
    ```properties
    spring.ai.openai.model=gpt-4 # Or any other model you have access to
    ```

## Building and Running the Application

This project includes a Gradle wrapper (`./gradlew` for Linux/macOS and `gradlew.bat` for Windows). It's recommended to use the wrapper to build and run the application, as it ensures version consistency.

1.  **Build the project:**
    Open your terminal in the project's root directory and run:
    ```bash
    ./gradlew build
    ```
    This command will compile the code and package it into a JAR file.

2.  **Run the application:**
    After a successful build, you can run the application using:
    ```bash
    ./gradlew bootRun
    ```
    Alternatively, you can run the executable JAR file created in the `build/libs/` directory:
    ```bash
    java -jar build/libs/demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
    ```
    The application will start, typically on `http://localhost:8080`.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with the AI endpoint.

**Endpoint:** `GET /ai`
**Query Parameter:** `prompt` (string) - The text prompt you want to send to the AI.

**Example using `curl`:**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/ai?prompt=Tell%20me%20a%20short%20story%20about%20a%20robot%20learning%20to%20paint"
```

The server will respond with a plain text string containing the AI-generated content.

---

This project uses Spring AI version 0.8.0. The main interaction point in the code is the `org.springframework.ai.chat.ChatClient`.
