# Spring AI Demo Project (Groovy Edition)

This project demonstrates a basic integration of Spring AI with a Spring Boot application, using Gradle with Groovy build scripts.

## Overview

The application provides a simple REST endpoint that accepts a text prompt and returns a response generated by an AI model (specifically OpenAI's GPT models via Spring AI).

## Prerequisites

*   **Java 17 or later:** Ensure you have a compatible JDK installed.
*   **Gradle:** The project uses the Gradle wrapper (`gradlew`), so you don't need a separate Gradle installation.
*   **OpenAI API Key:** You'll need an API key from OpenAI to use their models.

## Configuration

1.  **Set Your OpenAI API Key:**
    The application requires your OpenAI API key to be configured. Open the file:
    `src/main/resources/application.properties`

    Find the line:
    ```properties
    spring.ai.openai.api-key=YOUR_API_KEY
    ```
    Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual OpenAI API key.

2.  **Model Selection (Optional):**
    By default, the project is configured to use `gpt-3.5-turbo`. You can change this by modifying the `spring.ai.openai.model` property in the same `application.properties` file:
    ```properties
    spring.ai.openai.model=gpt-4 # Or any other model you have access to
    ```

## Project Structure

*   `/`: Contains the Spring Boot backend application (Gradle project).
*   `/frontend`: Contains the React frontend application.

## Building and Running

You need to run both the backend (Spring Boot) and the frontend (React) applications.

### 1. Backend (Spring Boot API)

The backend provides the AI interaction endpoint.

*   **Prerequisites:** Java 17, OpenAI API Key (see Configuration section).
*   **Build:**
    Navigate to the project root directory (`/`) and run:
    ```bash
    ./gradlew build
    ```
*   **Run:**
    After a successful build, run:
    ```bash
    ./gradlew bootRun
    ```
    Or run the JAR:
    ```bash
    java -jar build/libs/demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
    ```
    The backend will typically start on `http://localhost:8080`.

### 2. Frontend (React UI)

The frontend provides a web interface to chat with the AI.

*   **Prerequisites:** Node.js and npm (or yarn).
*   **Setup:**
    Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
    Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    (or `yarn install` if you prefer yarn)
*   **Run:**
    Once dependencies are installed, start the React development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    (or `yarn start`)
    This will usually open the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

**Important:** The Spring Boot backend application *must* be running for the frontend to successfully fetch AI responses.

## Usage

1.  Ensure both the backend and frontend applications are running as described above.
2.  Open your web browser and navigate to the frontend URL (typically `http://localhost:3000`).
3.  Type your prompt into the input field and click "Send". The AI's response will appear below.

You can still test the backend API directly using tools like `curl`:
**Endpoint:** `GET /ai`
**Query Parameter:** `prompt` (string)

**Example using `curl`:**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/ai?prompt=Tell%20me%20a%20short%20story%20about%20a%20robot%20learning%20to%20paint"
```
The server will respond with a plain text string containing the AI-generated content.

This project uses Spring AI version 0.8.0. The main interaction point in the code is the `org.springframework.ai.chat.ChatClient`.
